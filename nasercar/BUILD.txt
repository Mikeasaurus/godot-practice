Notes on building / installing:

Client:

Client side is exported as Web (runnable).  Some extra stuff is added into the
custom html header to get a thumbnail preview for links.  Also set no cache
on the page, which (if I read online correctly) will force browsers to
re-download the context if it's updated (e.g. for bug fixes).

E.g., something like this in the Head Include section:

<meta property="og:title" content="Nasercar">
<meta property="og:description" content="GVH kart racing game.">
<meta property="og:image" content="https://mikeasaurus.github.io/nasercar/index.icon.png" >
<meta http-equiv="Cache-Control" content="no-cache">

Also, enable virtual keyboard to help with mobile devices.  Mobile browsers
don't react to Godot's text boxes with their native virtual keyboard, so
Godot has to provide its own keyboard.


Server:

Multiplayer server is exported as Linux (runnable).
When launching the server, use options --headless --max-fps=45

This avoids initializing a display (which may not even exist on a VPS!), and
tones down the FPS.  Too many FPS, and the Websocket communication gets all
wonky.  However, too few FPS makes it too choppy/slow to play.  45 seems like
a good number after some tests.


Remember to uncheck "DEBUG" when exporting both client / server parts.
